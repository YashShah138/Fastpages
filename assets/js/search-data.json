            "content": "Notes . Look at how you have developed and compare yourself with classmates | Look at your passions and look at how cs can help | CS will be used almost anywhere and should know as base | CSP helped build the technical background of building UI/UX | Most of them always had passion for CS and developed that passion through CSA/CSP | They realized that CS could help people | Persevere through challenges | Have to focus on your own path, don’t be worried about what other people think/do | Transition from HS to college CS was quite drastic | Just break things down into little steps | Not expected to know everything, learn to use resources to fix errors and learn | Don’t cut corners, go above and beyond | Will not always have a path, don’t be so focused on the plan that you don’t start | Good to have the knowledge of PBL classes beforehand | Be able to ask questions | Able to automate menial tasks | CS has lots of utilizations and useful even if you are not majoring in it | Will apply the stuff in other classes | Stats uses R | Build relationships with professors to do work with them | . Reflection . There were several things that I learned from the student panel today. The first thing that I learned was that within the field of computer science, there will always be somebody that is better at something than you, and instead of being sad about that to focus on my own strengths and play to those. For example, if somebody is better at the syntax of the language and I am better with the logic, we can form a team where I can plan out the structure and flow of the code and my partner can code the program. The second thing I learned from the student panel was that no matter which field of study you go to, there will always be computer science to either make it more efficient or help with automation. The example that I remember from the panel is from Colin when he was talking about a script that he wrote to convert his notes from a .docx file into a spreadsheet. I connected this with the automation hack that we had for this week where we tried to automate the installation process of the packages. The third and most important thing, in my opinion, is to persevere. There will always be bugs or problems and you cannot give up because you didn’t find the bub. On example I remember is when Mabel was talking about how we all forget a semicolon or an indent and we just have to be patient and persevere through. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
