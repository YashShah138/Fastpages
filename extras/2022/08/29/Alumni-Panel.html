<p>There were several things that I learned from the student panel today. The first thing that I learned was that within the field of computer science, there will always be somebody that is better at something than you, and instead of being sad about that to focus on my own strengths and play to those. For example, if somebody is better at the syntax of the language and I am better with the logic, we can form a team where I can plan out the structure and flow of the code and my partner can code the program. The second thing I learned from the student panel was that no matter which field of study you go to, there will always be computer science to either make it more efficient or help with automation. The example that I remember from the panel is from Colin when he was talking about a script that he wrote to convert his notes from a .docx file into a spreadsheet. I connected this with the automation hack that we had for this week where we tried to automate the installation process of the packages. The third and most important thing, in my opinion, is to persevere. There will always be bugs or problems and you cannot give up because you didn’t find the bub. On example I remember is when Mabel was talking about how we all forget a semicolon or an indent and we just have to be patient and persevere through.</p>
