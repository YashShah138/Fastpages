## Score: 63/66

### Reflection

I think this time, I was  much stronger on the theoretical aspects of the quiz, but made stupid mistakes because I was rushing. I was able to somewhat remember DeMorgan's Law, but had to look it up to make sure I was correct. I made mistakes when I was skimming the code and not playing out the recursion or other theoretical questions.

### Questions

#### Question 37

The statement assigns a different value to b2 than the code segment assigns to b1 when num is between 0 and 100, exclusive.
