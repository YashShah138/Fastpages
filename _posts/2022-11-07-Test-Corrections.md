## Final Exam Reflection

I got 36/40. I think I did the best that I could, however I think I did better than I would on the AP test because I was not going with the timing of the test. Additionally, there were a few problems that really tricked me, such as the one that returned the recursive function twice instead of just once. Overall, I think that though this is a pretty good score. I need to pay more careful attention to the full question and not skim over the questions. I plan to study these concepts further and  do better on the next one as a result.
