## Notes

- Look at how you have developed and compare yourself with classmates
- Look at your passions and look at how cs can help
- CS will be used almost anywhere and should know as base
- CSP helped build the technical background of building UI/UX
- Most of them always had passion for CS and developed that passion through CSA/CSP
- They realized that CS could help people
- Persevere through challenges
- Have to focus on your own path, don't be worried about what other people think/do
- Transition from HS to college CS was quite drastic
- Just break things down into little steps
- Not expected to know everything, learn to use resources to fix errors and learn
- Don't cut corners, go above and beyond
- Will not always have a path, don't be so focused on the plan that you don't start
- Good to have the knowledge of PBL classes beforehand
- Be able to ask questions

- CS has lots of utilizations and useful even if you are not majoring in it
- Will apply the stuff in other classes
- Stats uses R
- Build relationships with professors to do work with them

## Reflection

There were several things that I learned from the student panel today. The first thing that I learned was that within the field of computer science, there will always be somebody that is better at something than you, and instead of being sad about that to focus on my own strengths and play to those. For example, if somebody is better at the syntax of the language and I am better with the logic, we can form a team where I can plan out the structure and flow of the code and my partner can code the program. The second thing I learned from the student panel was that no matter which field of study you go to, there will always be computer science to either make it more efficient or help with automation. The example that I remember from the panel is from Colin when he was talking about a script that he wrote to convert his notes from a .docx file into a spreadsheet. I connected this with the automation hack that we had for this week where we tried to automate the installation process of the packages. The third and most important thing, in my opinion, is to persevere. There will always be bugs or problems and you cannot give up because you didn't find the bub. On example I remember is when Mabel was talking about how we all forget a semicolon or an indent and we just have to be patient and persevere through.
