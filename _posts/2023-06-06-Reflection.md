# Reflection on my Senior Year in Data Structures 2

This course has taken me on a journey through computer science and I have learned many things. I have learned many skills, such as communication, teamwork, perseverance, and most importantly, how to use ChatGPT! Although I am partially joking no that last part, it has some truths. I learned how to  use ChatGPT to help debug my code and even help me partially fix my environment. There were several highs and lows throughout the year, but some of the most memorable were when we did the sorting dances in the PAC, prepping for the AP Exam (especially learning that we would have to hand write the FRQs), and being able to explore different aspects of computer science in this last part of the trimester. As I round out my senior year, I look ahead to the future that is in store and my future plans with computer science. I am majoring in computer science at the Southern Methodist University(SMU) this fall. As I look past the degrees in computer science, I plan to go into the financial sector and use my computer science skills to revolutionize that world and hopefully do a lot of good. Because my path into the financial sector is not concrete, I also may go into software engineering.
