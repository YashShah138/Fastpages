## Reflection

From the computer science and technical business panel, I learned a few things. The first thing that I learned is that when pursuing a job in the technology field, it is not needed to have a degree in software engineering, computer science, or other computer related degrees. We can see this from Mrs. Beveridge. She pursued a degree in finance and an MBA, but was able to pursue a job in the technology sector. I also learned that there are many paths to having a job in the big tech companies. From Mr. Porter, we saw that he went from being unemployed to working at a startup, then a job where tech isn't the product/service being sold, to working for a big tech firm. Mrs. Beveridge and Mr. Porter have encouraged me to pursue a degree in computer science ans combine it with a degree in finance, as there are many opportunities in both worlds. I love working with numbers and that is what draws me to finance; I also love programming which is what drew me to computer science. As I was applying to colleges, I was worried that I would only be able to pursue one of my passions, but listening to this panel and hearing their paths to tech jobs, I am more confident that I will be able to find a job in a tech sector regardless of my background and I will be able to use both of my passions in my job.
