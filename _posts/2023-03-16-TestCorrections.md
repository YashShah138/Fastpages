# Test corrections and Reflection

## Reflection

I think I did much better on this AP MC exam than on the previous ones. I felt like I at least understood how to do every question, even if some may have taken me a bit longer. I did keep a good pace too, so that was good. Overall, it seems that all of the questions that I missed had to do with trouble shooting code and spotting errors. In the future, I should work on getting better at spotting errors in code and seeing what is causing a specific error

## Questions

### Q9
I got this one wrong because each value has equal probability, versus splitting up the dice which would make certain probabilities more, and 1 cannot be included so E is correct.

### Q11
The answer is wrong because the reverse of “nono” is “onon” and since these two strings are not equal, the method will return false and the answer is E

### Q19
The answer is wrong because all 3 statements are correct. Statement two only runs once so it wont print anything, and Statement three only contains odd numbers so it wont print anything since % 2 wont do anything, and the answer is E

### Q30
This answers is wrong because the first one just runs each segment of code versus only running if it has a certain condition, which would be checked in else if and else, so only two works.

### Q31
This answer is wrong because as it loops through, it creates less and less X's into the code and the one i selected would be possible if there was for loops checking for even or odd.
